<p>Clayton keeps talking about how Jeezy is good for our "team dynamic," and I think he's right.  I don't know what Clayton has planned, but I would be surprised if he stays at Inverse for long time.  It seems to me that inverse will likely get lost in all of the other new media sites.  But either way I think Clayton is probably excited about doing his own thing.  I could get behind that.  We'll see.  If it does happen we'll need a KweezyLabs setup.</p>
<br>
<p>What is a KweezyLabs setup?  We were at my parents house who were gone for the weekend.  The first element is visualizing the code.  We cleared off a wall in the living room, removing what I called the bird painting in my childhood--despite the fact that the contents of the painting doesn't look remotely avian.  Somehow I found a projector in the mess that is my dad's study, grabbed an HDMI, a lightning adapter, and we were in business.  The code was on the wall.  On the feaking wall.  The bulk of AV experience I have had in my life has conditioned me to expect complete technical failure at worst, and utter confusion and delay and best when using equipment like projectors.  But it just worked.  It was glorious.  The second element of KweezyLabs is the tunes.  Again miraculously this part just worked.  The surround sound system that my dad installed over 20 years ago is still kickin, but its notoriously difficult to get going.  But there was the exact cable I needed, just right there.  That NEVER happens.  Hooked up my phone, got the trap flowing in glourious Dolby 5.1 surround.  The last element of our successful KweezyLabs setup was the beer.  Balmer curve here we come.</p>
<br>
<p>Other elements that would make for a successful KweezyLabs setup:  white boards, kegerator, and just an overall more bro aesthetic instead of middle-class-Little-Rock-family-of-four vibe that we were working with.  In all though it was an extremely dope setup.</p>
<br>
<p>There's something about seeing the code you write projected onto a wall.  One of the issues that I've always had with programming (especially with something that's just a command line app like Jeezy is at this point) is that its strictly limited to the machine you run it on.  You spend all of this time "creating" something by typing away at a keyboard, then something  happens in the black box, and you're rewarded with some  interaction with with your shiny screen.  It starts an ends at the machine.  And don't get me wrong, this is an incredible and satisfying process.  I consistently refer to what we're doing with Jeezy as magic.  But there's something about seeing your code, the actual code itself, escape the screen and enter the real world.  It gives a concreteness to it, and the code is no longer just the means to the shiny end.  The code itself is the product.</p>
<br>
<p>Anyway, I strongly recommend putting your code on a wall.  If nothing else its l33t af.</p>
<br>
<p>The work flow is pretty good.  Clayton definitely fashions himself a hacker, trying to work as fast as possible, with the idea that if you keep throwing up code it'll work eventually.  I tend to want to be more thoughtful on the front end and make sure everything is really well defined.  It's interesting because he is also very obsessed with testing (and the fact that we don't have any sort of testing setup yet is troublesome to him).  Having test procedures would make it easier to check code as you write it and thus easier to iterate through more solutions, but If you're solution that eventually works isn't great...  Any way to this point its gone very well with Clayton driving a lot of development oriented ideas, me contributing more theoretical ideas and implementation nuances, and both of us continuing to come up with quality ideas about the product of JeezyAI itself.</p>
